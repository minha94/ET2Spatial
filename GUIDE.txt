Tool: ET2Spatial
This tool converts the screen coordinates of eye-tracking data recorded on a webmap, to real-world coordinates.

HOW TO USE:-
-Download the tool as a zip. After unzipping, double click the exe file. The tool takes maximum 1 minute to compile. The icon files should be in the same directory as the exe file
For Eye-tracking Data following convention should be followed: 
-In the Raw gaze points: ['Time of Day [h:m:s:ms]','RecordingTime [ms]','Point of Regard Right X [px]','Point of Regard Right Y [px]','Participant','Gender','Age']
-In the Fixations gaze points following elements should exist: ['Event Start Trial Time [ms]','Event Duration [ms]','Fixation Position X [px]','Fixation Position Y [px]''Participant','Gender','Age']
-For the User Interaction file, The tool currently only works with MapTrack export (http://eyetracking.upol.cz/maptrack/results) 
-On the initiation of the tool a terminal window also opens, The notifications for the export buttons are printed in this window.

SYSTEM SETUP:-
The tool is standalone and should not need additional installations. However incase of problems, these are the reccommended steps:
1. Installation of Python v 3.5+ on the local system (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/), Make sure that you add python to PATH
2. Installation of the packages. In the requirements.txt all the necessary modules are listed, you can install them individually or through 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in shell.


EXPORTS:-
The exports are named after the participant number which was given in input files. 
The tool exports 1) shapefile: Which will produce CSV and Shapefiles for both raw points and fixation points. The shapefiles are exported in the EPSG 3857 Projection System.
		 2) GeoJSON: Which will produce GeoJSON for both raw points and fixation points

SHAPEFILE:-
.shp, .shx, .dbf
The shapefile has the following contents:
--------Raw Points.shp
	ind : index or serial number in temporal order
	latitude: in decimal degrees
	longitude: in decimal degrees
	zoom level: the Google maps zoom factor at which each point was recorded
	Format_RT: the time stamp in millisecond for each point
--------Fixation Points.shp
	ind : index or serial number in temporal order
	latitude: in decimal degrees
	longitude: in decimal degrees
	zoom level: the Google maps zoom factor at which each point was recorded
	Sync_time: the time stamp in millisecond for each point
	Duration: the amount of time of a fixation on screen
Along with the shapefile export there is a:
	PROJECTION FILE:It contains the information on the projection of the exported points in WKT format
	CSV FILES: all the above mentioned attributes of points in csv format.

GEOJSON:-
The geojson file contains a point geometry file with associated properties:
--------Raw Points.geojson
	Geometry: latitude, longitude
	Properties: zoom level, Format_RT
--------Fixation Points.geojson
	Geometry: latitude, longitude
	Properties: zoom level, Sync_time, Duration
	
	
GETTING DATA FROM MAPTRACK:
	To use MapTrack data with Eye-tracker, it must be selected as a stimulus in presentation settings. 
	Enter the participant Id, Matching with the one entered in Eye-tracking system. Press F11 to enter fullscreen mode. Press F2 to start.
	After the experiment is finished, Press F2 again to terminate the 'interaction mode'. The results can be accessed at: http://eyetracking.upol.cz/maptrack/results/
	Download the xml file for the relevant participant ID and finished time.
